Clicking the X button on the one-tap prompt dismisses the prompt.
 If you refresh the page after this, you won't see the button come back. Why?

The One Tap library has some additional side effects around dismissing the prompt.
If you've clicked the X button, a cookie has been added to your domain called g_state. 
if you clear that cookie value, you'll see the prompt come back.

Clicking the X button more than once will enter you into an Exponential Cool Down mode. What does that mean?

The One Tap Sign-In button only works on Chrome & Firefox across Android, iOS, macOS, Linux, Window 10. 
If you have users on Safari or Edge, they won't see the prompt
