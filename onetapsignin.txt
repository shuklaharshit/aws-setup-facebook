(In react)
const initializeGsi = () => {
        google.accounts.id.initialize({
            client_id: 'insert-your-client-id-here',
        });
        google.accounts.id.prompt(notification => {
            console.log(notification)
        });

    useEffect(() => {
        const script = document.createElement('script')
        script.src = 'https://accounts.google.com/gsi/client'
        script.onload = initializeGSI()

That means you need to decode the ID token to get the users info.
We can do that by adding the jwt-decode library with 
    npm install --save jwt-decode

Clicking the X button on the one-tap prompt dismisses the prompt.
 If you refresh the page after this, you won't see the button come back. Why?

The One Tap library has some additional side effects around dismissing the prompt.
If you've clicked the X button, a cookie has been added to your domain called g_state. 
if you clear that cookie value, you'll see the prompt come back.

Clicking the X button more than once will enter you into an Exponential Cool Down mode. What does that mean?

You cannot clear cookies or use an incognito window to get around it .
It seems to be based on your browser and website (maybe IP?). If you accidentally run into this, time to take a break.
Or try a different browser/website URL.

The One Tap Sign-In button only works on Chrome & Firefox across Android, iOS, macOS, Linux, Window 10.

If you have users on Safari or Edge, they won't see the prompt


If the user closes the One Tap prompt manually, the One Tap prompt is suppressed. A user closes One Tap when they tap Close close in the top-right corner of the prompt. One Tap won't display in the same browser or the last website visited for a period of time.

The following exponential time periods are used for cooldowns:

Consecutive times closed	Time period that One Tap is disabled
1	                            Two hours
2	                            One day
3	                            One week
4+	                            Four weeks
